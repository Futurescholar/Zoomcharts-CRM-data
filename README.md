# Zoomcharts-CRM-Data Visualization Project Report

## Title:
CRM Sales Performance for the Year 2024 Dashboard 
## Objective:
To analyze and evaluate the performance of the sales team across countries, industries, and agents to uncover insights that can help optimize deal closure rates, reduce lost leads, and improve sales conversion efficiency.
---
## Problem Statement
- What is the overall conversion rate of sales leads across countries and agents?
- Which industries and products generate the most closed deals?
- Which agents are top performers in terms of deal value closed?
- What is the average deal cycle duration and how can it be reduced?
- Where are we losing the most leads in the sales funnel?
---
## Tools Used
Power BI
---
## Visualization Approach
- I loaded the data  into Power BI.
- I used DAX for calculating KPIs such as Total Closed Deal Value, Conversion Rate, Lost Leads %, and Avg Days to Close a Deal.
- I Created KPI cards for quick insights:
  - Total Deals: 3000
  - Total Deal Closed: $931,275
  - Conversion Rate: 11.60%
  - Avg Days to Close a Deal: 63.17
  - Avg Deal Value: $2,758.4
  - Lost Leads %: 2.03%
- I used Bar Charts to visualize:
    - Deal Value Closed by Agent
    - Closed Deal Value by Industry
    - Leads by Stage (Sales Funnel)
- I used a Pie Chart to represent:
     - Product Distribution by Closed Deals (SAAS, Services, Custom Solutions)
- I used Matrix Table:
    - Country-wise breakdown of total leads, deals closed, conversion rate, avg. time to close, lost leads %, and avg deal value.
- Then I added Filters based on:
    - Country, Product, Month, Industry, Agent, Organization
